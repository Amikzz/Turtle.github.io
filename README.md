# Turtle Website: Sri Lanka

Welcome to the Turtle Website project! This is a web application dedicated to showcasing turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka, providing information about turtle conservation, and offering ticket booking functionality for visiting these hatcheries.

This is the first web project I worked on, and it demonstrates my skills in building a functional and visually appealing website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: The structure and content of the website are built using HTML5, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.
- **CSS**: Styling is achieved with CSS3 to create a visually engaging and responsive design. Flexbox and Grid are used for layout management.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and dynamic content are managed with vanilla JavaScript to enhance user experience and functionality.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website functions well and looks great on various devices and screen sizes.

## Usage
Explore the website to learn about turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka and use the ticket booking feature to plan your visit. The source code is available for review, and you can see how the website is built and styled.
